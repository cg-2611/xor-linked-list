# XOR Linked List

An [XOR linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_linked_list) implementation in C. Each node in the linked list stores a string.

### Usage
---
To use this in a program, simply add both `xorll.h` and `xorll.c` in your project directory, and include it add to your program:
```c
#include "xorll.h"
```
Then when compiling your program, ensure that `xorll.c` is also compiled along with your program. 
For example, for a demonstration, use the provided `main.c`. Compile into a single binary using:
```
clang -o main main.c xorll.c
```
Then the binary file `main` can be run.
> Note: you can use any C compiler of your choice, as well as any compiler options of your choice.
